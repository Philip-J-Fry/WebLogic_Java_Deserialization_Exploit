# WebLogic_Java_Deserialization_Exploit
Modification of original exploit coded by SlidingWindow - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42806/

The original exploit has been modified for a PoC, a bit comfortable way to leverage Oracle Weblogic Server vuln. 

Everytime you have to launch a command on the vulnerable target, the original script must be modified:
  new payload, generated by ysoserial, must be put in chunk2 variable of original exploit

The script makes this process automatic. 

Obviously ysoserial must be installed.

	./WebLogic_deser.py ip port [-p payload] -x command
